## The 12 Coping Styles: Lived Experience Descriptions

### DISCONNECTED → Connected

Those with the Disconnected Coping Style live at a strange distance from life. They experience the world as if through a pane of glass—they can see the warmth and connection that others share so naturally, but can never quite reach or be reached by it. They feel like outsiders who don't belong, carrying a deep ache of feeling perpetually unknown, unheard, unseen, or misunderstood. They feel fundamentally different somehow—as if they exist on a separate wavelength, or didn't get the manual on how to be human that everyone else seems to have.

They often feel lonely, even surrounded by people who care. They hold back from being fully real because they don't believe anyone could truly understand them. It can be hard for them to build trust with people—they often feel an ambivalent push-pull around intimacy.

**Subtypes**:

**FLIGHTY**: Wherever they are feels itchy-scratchy—like the wrong fit—and they're dying to get to the next thing. They spend most of their time dreaming of a new city, job, or relationship that holds the promise of belonging. Any time something feels uncomfortable, they're possessed by the urge to bolt. They don't fully invest because they're sure wherever they are is only temporary. Resistant to commitment—scared of getting trapped.

**FLOATY**: They find safe refuge in their inner world of imagination. They stay absorbed in daydreams because the real world feels uncomfortable and unreachable. Living in a pleasant haze, numbed to the raw pain and anxiety of life. Detached from their bodies—attention and energy hovering above, looking down at life from a safe distance. They often lose track of time, struggle to pay attention, and have difficulty staying present.

**STIFF**: They live primarily in their heads, disconnected from bodies and feelings. They prefer logical interactions where everything makes sense. They take refuge from the chaotic unpredictability of human emotions in spaces with predictable certainty—like programming, engineering, facts, quiz shows. The mysterious world of emotions feels alien. They brace against life by unconsciously stiffening their bodies.

**MASKED**: They don't feel Disconnected—they pride themselves on exceptional capacity to attune. So many people tell them they "get" them like no one else. They're like attunement-bots, calibrated to make others feel felt. But they unwittingly lose touch with their own internal world. Either "leaned-out" (faking connection while internally distant) or "leaned-in" (trying harder and harder to be understood).

### FRICTIVE → Still

Those with the Frictive Coping Style live with a core sense that their very existence is tentative—that things could disappear at any moment. There's no centrifugal force holding things together. Nothing sticks. Everything's moving in a frenetic way. They have to use outside things to hold themselves together—grabbing, grasping, creating friction to tether themselves here.

There's constant anxiety—a full body panic and terror. It feels like the self could fragment, come apart, disintegrate. Like falling through space with nothing to catch them. Any space, silence, or stopping feels like an empty void that could swallow them. They do anything to avoid the void. Transitions (moves, job changes) feel like frightening existential disappearing.

---

### OMNIPOTENT → Centered

Those with the Omnipotent Coping Style don't really get to form a sense of self—there's no membrane separating them from their environment. Everything outside feels like part of the self. Uncomfortable things outside are so stimulating inside. They need everything out there to be just right or else everything feels ruined.

They're like the Princess and the Pea—hypersensitive to every little thing. Smallest things could destroy everything. They don't know the difference between "shrug-offable" and "nuclear," just like a newborn baby. When something feels bad, they try to figure it out, fix it, change it. They push for total control of everything and everyone when triggered. They can be reactive, explosive, intense.

They live in splits and extremes—all-good or all-bad, black and white. When bad comes, they don't see any good. They don't hold perspective. We often look like assholes, bullies—so forceful. But at the core, just tender, skinless, frightened babies who don't know how to calm down.

---

### DEPRIVED → Resourced

Those with the Deprived Coping Style begin with a sense that the thing they want or need out there doesn't want them. There's longing for something good to come, and it doesn't. The love doesn't come. The outsides feel like a back turned away.

Because the good doesn't come, their insides start to feel really bad. They're too young to figure out there must be something wrong with the outsides—instead they feel there must be something wrong with ME. Darkness inside, heaviness, a sinking feeling of badness. Feeling broken, cursed. Empty in a gnawing way. Ugly, defective, repulsive, unlovable.

The good doesn't resonate with the bad feeling inside, so they can't take in good. Feeling good feels impossible or wrong. They learn to feed on the bad—self-pity, bitterness, loneliness. From this desperate, empty place, they get grabby. They have to do something manipulative, do something to get love.

**Subtypes include**: WOUNDED (victim, poor me), INDISPENSABLE (need to be needed), ELUSIVE (stay just out of reach), PURSUING (chasing unavailable people), CHARMING (put on happy face, empty inside), SCAVENGING (sneaking what they need), STOCKPILING (nothing ever enough).

---

### SYMBIOTIC → Solid

Those with the Symbiotic Coping Style experience something big and scary outside that won't let them be themselves. The outside thing has so much power, knowing, influence, certainty, bigness. The only way to stay connected—which feels like survival—is to stay limp inside. To go to a flaccid, foggy, undefined, uncertain place where it feels like they're not allowed to have their own mind, knowing, or separate self.

They had a choice: I can have me, OR I can empty myself out and have them. But not both. They put relationships above self. They feel dependent on the other in an undefinable way. They become hyper-focused on the other, needing them to be okay, needing them to like them at all times.

They have to be pleasing, easy-going, agree, go along with. Fear of conflict is terrifying. They never really say no. Identity shifts based on who they're around like a chameleon. No anchor in self. They end up telling little white lies to make people happy. Rage and resentment build, then they cut off completely.

---

### PREMATURE → Nourished

Those with the Premature Coping Style experience a natural, normal need—that there's something outside that needs to get inside. All living things need to absorb things from outside to stay alive. But as soon as they started showing capability, all of a sudden they didn't get to be the "baby" anymore.

The help and care stops. They get praise for being precocious—but the need doesn't go away, it just doesn't get met. The hunger itself starts to feel like a bad part. Shame for the hunger. They worry they're too much for others, a burden. So they avoid their need, get big, take care of things, others.

They become very self-reliant, self-sufficient. Pouring all energy out—volunteering, supporting, over-giving, over-achieving. They get to feel love only in giving. But receiving care feels confusing, wrong. They have fantasies about being sick or injured so someone would have to care for them. They often end up exhausted, drained, depleted—yet keep pushing. Then collapse.

---

### IDEALIZING → Human

Those with the Idealizing Coping Style never had their internal world mirrored. All the focus was on outsides—things that could be measured, ranked, evaluated. Appearance, accomplishments, intelligence, success. They don't get to feel themselves inside—their essence, their life-force, their sentience.

Life feels like competition: my outsides versus your outsides. Winners and losers. They rate people based on status, looks, achievements. See the world through a vertical hierarchy—craning necks to look up at people and down at people. They worry: if I'm not superior, I'm inferior.

They go from inflated grandiosity where they're better than everyone, to deflated worthlessness when they're not the best. Highly unstable sense of self. They create a false presentational self to stay on top. Any blemish feels catastrophic. Hypersensitive to criticism. They put up unbreakable walls, won't take accountability. Lonely, empty.

---

### FRUSTRATED → In Flow

Those with the Frustrated Coping Style experience exploring their willpower and being met with a big "NO" from outside. Blocked, thwarted, shut down, defeated, ignored. It feels like they don't have a choice, don't get a say. Things feel impossible, life feels hard, nothing is easy. Everything is against me.

Rightfully angry—but usually not aware of this anger. It feels passive and impotent. They don't know how to aim it constructively, so it festers into toxic hate. Their anger becomes secretly aimed at sabotaging themselves and everyone else. It feels good to feel bad—a protest.

They hold onto bitterness, resentment. Don't let go. They say NO indirectly by being passive aggressive. They make others feel as Frustrated as they do.

**Subtypes**: SUBVERTING (yes out loud, no underhandedly), SACRIFICING (golden child by being selfless, tallying invisible points), WITHHOLDING (won't let anything in or out, win by refusing to play), WITHSTANDING (power in ability to endure, attracted to struggle).

---

### INDULGED → Aware

Those with the Indulged Coping Style explore their will and weren't stopped. Their impulsive will won and ran the show. They didn't learn how they impact others—focused on their own instant gratification. As adults, they're often unaware of how their embodiment—volume, tone, timing—affects the space.

They seek pleasure and avoid discomfort. Their needs feel like the most important thing. They can be grabby, entitled, impatient, wanting without limits. They want instant gratification, won't wait. Rules seem silly—above the law. They want the world to adapt to them, not vice versa.

When others miss them, they can be quite reactive. They lose touch with the fact that others are complex beings with needs and feelings. They push boundaries through impatient entitlement and get confused when they lose relationships.

**KEY SIGNAL**: When someone describes normal adult tasks (planning, deciding, managing logistics) as overwhelming, burdensome, "too adulty," or unfairly hard—this signals INDULGED. They experience "adults/authority/rules/limits" as the oppressive OUTSIDE, rather than as natural adult function.

---

### SQUASHED → Erect

Those with the Squashed Coping Style started to develop their power and beauty, but someone in their family had destructive envy. They saw that any moments where they got attention or praise triggered ugly jealousy. Everybody's love mattered so much—they didn't want to lose love. So they found a way to dim the light.

But the light is unstoppable—it just goes underground, shines brighter without their awareness. They naturally stand out, light up the room. Have joy and kindness. But they feel utterly un-enviable. Don't feel they have anything special.

They hide their shine, shrink, play small. Self-deprecating. Deflect compliments or return them right away. Never take up too much space or win too big. Don't want to be hated. Their squashers seem so big, holding power over them.

---

### PROVOCATIVE → Protective

Those with the Provocative Coping Style weren't protected. They were over-exposed to sexuality, used as a stand-in partner—emotionally or physically. Treated as a true rival. Their overexposure felt exciting but also really bad at the same time. Things at home were dramatic—big feelings, big fights, allegiances, betrayals.

They learned that connecting is exciting and intense and boundary-less. The only way to feel connection is through a lot of charge, intensity. They're loose and uncontained, impulsive. Addiction to the rush—of highs, playing fast and loose, transgressions, pushing people's buttons.

They provoke—either erotic obsession (desire, lust, adoration) or anger (rivalry, fights). The fallout is confusing—getting in trouble, in danger, violated. They feel murky and foggy about their own provocative parts. They feel innocent. But big, intense things keep happening all around them.

---

### CONSTRICTED → Free

Those with the Constricted Coping Style experience unrestrained life force as dangerous. They learn to constrict and clamp down tight around their vitality. They see life through a moralistic split between good and bad—which are synonyms for right and wrong. SO important to always be right and never be wrong.

They feel like there's a Judge outside watching—constantly monitored, at risk of being caught and exposed, punished or humiliated. They try to blend in, keep heads down. Making even the smallest mistake could lead to devastating consequences—shunned, ostracized, reduced to nothing.

They live in their heads—planning, analyzing, controlling, rehearsing. They don't allow their real, raw selves to be seen. Stuck in endless loops of indecision. Their anger is buried so deep they don't know it exists. It shows up as intrusive violent thoughts, OCD rituals. Sex feels bad—they can only connect to it in shameful, secretive ways.
