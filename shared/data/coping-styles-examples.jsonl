{"prompt": "Okay, so back in August, I noticed that there was bubbling paint on my car in several different places, so I looked it up online for that model of car, and it said that it's an issue with that car. So I went to the dealership and I went. I took the car to the dealership where I bought it, and I showed them the paint, and they said that, yes, it is a problem, but that they don't fix it there, but they could file a claim with Jeep for me, since the car was still under warranty. So that was in August, and they told me that it might take a couple of months for me to hear back from them. So I checked in with them after a couple of months, and they told me there was still a couple of people ahead of me. And. Then I brought my car to be serviced another time and asked again. Following that, I got an email asking about my experience with the dealership, and if I had any issues. I shared the issue with the president of the company, and they said, although they couldn't help me, they would have somebody contact me. And that didn't happen. So I went there today to drop off my car for an oil change, and I asked about the problem again, and they again told me that there's two people ahead of me and that I will hear from them when they hear back from Jeep.", "coping_styles": ["Disconnected", "Frustrated", "Sacrificing"], "code": "consumer_frustration", "metadata": {"source": "google_sheets_import", "validated": false, "date_added": "2026-01-06", "note": "raw_diagnosis to be added after professional review"}}
